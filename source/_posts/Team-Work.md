title: Team work we need

## Why

When we build deep research, we need lots of basic but best toolkits like web search/extract and pdf reader.

One person build the pipeline

One person tackle web search/extract

One person does research on pdf extract

and so on...

We're not island, we need team work and share, 
then we can make best production in the world.
